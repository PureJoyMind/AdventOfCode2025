## Solutions to Advent of Code 2025 Challenges
[Link to the challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

Each solution is in  it's own directory in a static class with the challenge number for it's name.
Each static challenge class like `Ch01` has a method called `Solve` which solves the challenge.
I've tried to make useful comments and make the solutions clean and readable.

***Note: All the solutions are pushed to the repo after they've been submitted and accepted by the site so there's no wrong answer.***
